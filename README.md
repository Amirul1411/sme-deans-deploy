#### Web Client

Web Client System is the Graphical User Interface of the Crisis Management System and the entry point for users. It is built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS using ReactJS framework and Redux as state manager.

#### Core API

Core API System handles all requests between Web Client and Notification. It provides RESTful API endpoints and is built with Python using Django Rest Framework. Django Channels and Redis are used to implement WebSocket to achieve duplex communication with Web Client System. To schedule periodic task such as sending crisis summary report, Core API makes use of Django Cron. All persistence data are stored in a Postgresql database.

#### Notification

Notification handles requests from Core API and dispatch notifications accordingly. It is built on Python-Flask and integrated with Facebook API, Twitter API, SMTP Email Client and Twilio SMS API.
